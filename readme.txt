What's included:

This download is a webpage showcasing 15 of my favorite movies.

/According to the code,
/the information stored involves four classes: 
  [title, storyline, poster-image, and the movie's trailer]


/This translates to four files:
entertainment_center.py
media.py
fresh_tomatoes.py
fresh_tomatoes.html


Requirements:
File needs to be unzipped into its four child files,
Other than this there are no special requirements 
or commands to take into account for this file



Running the program:

I included an html copy of the page 
called "Fresh_tomatoes.html" which is easy to load and run in the browser

However, to load your own in the browser, some information may be helpful:
'Entertainment center' contains all information for the listed movies,
'Media' shows the class structure for the movies including an initializing function,
'fresh tomatoes' is the html/css/js template used for the website

Run the 'entertainment_center.py' file in your Python IDLE to generate your own HTML webpage
